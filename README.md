# go-neural-network

A feedforward neural network that learns with backpropagation (Mean Squared Error) and stochastic gradient descent.

Currently gets 5.6% error on the MNIST database ([using GoMNIST](https://github.com/petar/GoMNIST)) with two 300-node layers.

Includes a function to visualize learned representations:
